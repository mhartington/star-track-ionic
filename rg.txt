ripgrep 0.5.0
Andrew Gallant <jamslam@gmail.com>

ripgrep (rg) recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern.

ripgrep's regex engine uses finite automata and guarantees linear time
searching. Because of this, features like backreferences and arbitrary
lookaround are not supported.

USAGE:ripgrep [OPTIONS] <pattern> [--] [path]...

ARGS:
    <pattern>
            A regular expression used for searching. Multiple patterns may be given. To match a
            pattern beginning with a -, use [-].
             
    <path>...
            A file or directory to search. Directories are searched recursively.
             

OPTIONS:
    -A, --after-context <NUM>
            Show NUM lines after each match.
             
    -B, --before-context <NUM>
            Show NUM lines before each match.
             
    -s, --case-sensitive
            Search case sensitively. This overrides -i/--ignore-case and -S/--smart-case.
             
        --color <WHEN>
            When to use color in the output. The possible values are never, auto, always or ansi.
            The default is auto. When always is used, coloring is attempted based on your
            environment. When ansi used, coloring is forcefully done using ANSI escape color codes.
             
        --colors <SPEC>...
            This flag specifies color settings for use in the output. This flag may be provided
            multiple times. Settings are applied iteratively. Colors are limited to one of eight
            choices: red, blue, green, cyan, magenta, yellow, white and black. Styles are limited to
            nobold, bold, nointense or intense.
            
            The format of the flag is {type}:{attribute}:{value}. {type} should be one of path, line
            or match. {attribute} can be fg, bg or style. {value} is either a color (for fg and bg)
            or a text style. A special format, {type}:none, will clear all color settings for
            {type}.
            
            For example, the following command will change the match color to magenta and the
            background color for line numbers to yellow:
            
            rg --colors 'match:fg:magenta' --colors 'line:bg:yellow' foo.
             
        --column
            Show column numbers (1-based). This only shows the column numbers for the first match on
            each line. This does not try to account for Unicode. One byte is equal to one column.
            This implies --line-number.
             
    -C, --context <NUM>
            Show NUM lines before and after each match.
             
        --context-separator <SEPARATOR>
            The string used to separate non-contiguous context lines in the output. Escape sequences
            like \x7F or \t may be used. The default value is --.
             
    -c, --count
            Only show count of matches for each file.
             
        --debug
            Show debug messages. Please use this when filing a bug report.
             
    -E, --encoding <ENCODING>
            Specify the text encoding that ripgrep will use on all files searched. The default value
            is 'auto', which will cause ripgrep to do a best effort automatic detection of encoding
            on a per-file basis. Other supported values can be found in the list of labels here:
            https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-encoding-get
             
    -f, --file <FILE>...
            Search for patterns from the given file, with one pattern per line. When this flag is
            used or multiple times or in combination with the -e/--regexp flag, then all patterns
            provided are searched. Empty pattern lines will match all input lines, and the newline
            is not counted as part of the pattern.
             
        --files
            Print each file that would be searched without actually performing the search. This is
            useful to determine whether a particular file is being searched or not.
             
    -l, --files-with-matches
            Only show the paths with at least one match.
             
        --files-without-match
            Only show the paths that contains zero matches.
             
    -F, --fixed-strings
            Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression. When this flag is
            used, special regular expression meta characters such as (){}*+. do not need to be
            escaped.
             
    -L, --follow
            Follow symbolic links.
             
    -g, --glob <GLOB>...
            Include or exclude files/directories for searching that match the given glob. This
            always overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob flags may be used. Globbing rules
            match .gitignore globs. Precede a glob with a ! to exclude it.
             
        --heading
            This shows the file name above clusters of matches from each file instead of showing the
            file name for every match. This is the default mode at a tty.
             
        --help
            When given, more details about flags are provided.
             
    -h
            Show short help output. Use --help to show more details.
             
        --hidden
            Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories are
            skipped.
             
    -i, --ignore-case
            Case insensitive search. This is overridden by --case-sensitive.
             
        --ignore-file <FILE>...
            Specify additional ignore files for filtering file paths. Ignore files should be in the
            gitignore format and are matched relative to the current working directory. These ignore
            files have lower precedence than all other ignore files. When specifying multiple ignore
            files, earlier files have lower precedence than later files.
             
    -v, --invert-match
            Invert matching. Show lines that don't match given patterns.
             
    -n, --line-number
            Show line numbers (1-based). This is enabled by default when searching in a tty.
             
    -M, --max-columns <NUM>
            Don't print lines longer than this limit in bytes. Longer lines are omitted, and only
            the number of matches in that line is printed.
             
    -m, --max-count <NUM>
            Limit the number of matching lines per file searched to NUM.
             
        --max-filesize <NUM+SUFFIX?>
            Ignore files larger than NUM in size. Does not ignore directories. 
            
            The input format accepts suffixes of K, M or G which correspond to kilobytes, megabytes
            and gigabytes. If no suffix is provided the input is treated as bytes. 
            
            Example: --max-filesize 50K or --max-filesize 80M
             
        --maxdepth <NUM>
            Limit the depth of directory traversal to NUM levels beyond the paths given. A value of
            zero only searches the starting-points themselves.
            
            For example, 'rg --maxdepth 0 dir/' is a no-op because dir/ will not be descended into.
            'rg --maxdepth 1 dir/' will search only the direct children of dir/.
             
        --mmap
            Search using memory maps when possible. This is enabled by default when ripgrep thinks
            it will be faster. Note that memory map searching doesn't currently support all options,
            so if an incompatible option (e.g., --context) is given with --mmap, then memory maps
            will not be used.
             
        --no-filename
            Never show the file name for a match. This is the default when one file is searched.
             
        --no-heading
            Don't group matches by each file. If -H/--with-filename is enabled, then file names will
            be shown for every line matched. This is the default mode when not at a tty.
             
        --no-ignore
            Don't respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.). This implies --no-ignore-parent
            and --no-ignore-vcs.
             
        --no-ignore-parent
            Don't respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.) in parent directories.
             
        --no-ignore-vcs
            Don't respect version control ignore files (.gitignore, etc.). This implies
            --no-ignore-parent. Note that .ignore files will continue to be respected.
             
    -N, --no-line-number
            Suppress line numbers. This is enabled by default when NOT searching in a tty.
             
        --no-messages
            Suppress all error messages. This is equivalent to redirecting stderr to /dev/null.
             
        --no-mmap
            Never use memory maps, even when they might be faster.
             
        --null
            Whenever a file name is printed, follow it with a NUL byte. This includes printing file
            names before matches, and when printing a list of matching files such as with --count,
            --files-with-matches and --files. This option is useful for use with xargs.
             
        --path-separator <SEPARATOR>
            The path separator to use when printing file paths. This defaults to your platform's
            path separator, which is / on Unix and \ on Windows. This flag is intended for
            overriding the default when the environment demands it (e.g., cygwin). A path separator
            is limited to a single byte.
             
    -p, --pretty
            Alias for --color always --heading -n.
             
    -q, --quiet
            Do not print anything to stdout. If a match is found in a file, stop searching. This is
            useful when ripgrep is used only for its exit code.
             
    -e, --regexp <pattern>...
            A regular expression used for searching. Multiple patterns may be given. To match a
            pattern beginning with a -, use [-].
             
    -r, --replace <ARG>
            Replace every match with the string given when printing results. Neither this flag nor
            any other flag will modify your files.
            
            Capture group indices (e.g., $5) and names (e.g., $foo) are supported in the replacement
            string.
            
            Note that the replacement by default replaces each match, and NOT the entire line. To
            replace the entire line, you should match the entire line.
             
    -V, --version
            Prints version information.
             
    -S, --smart-case
            Searches case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase. Search case sensitively
            otherwise. This is overridden by either -s/--case-sensitive or -i/--ignore-case.
             
        --sort-files
            Sort results by file path. Note that this currently disables all parallelism and runs
            search in a single thread.
             
    -a, --text
            Search binary files as if they were text.
             
    -j, --threads <ARG>
            The approximate number of threads to use. A value of 0 (which is the default) causes
            ripgrep to choose the thread count using heuristics.
             
    -t, --type <TYPE>...
            Only search files matching TYPE. Multiple type flags may be provided. Use the
            --type-list flag to list all available types.
             
        --type-add <TYPE>...
            Add a new glob for a particular file type. Only one glob can be added at a time.
            Multiple --type-add flags can be provided. Unless --type-clear is used, globs are added
            to any existing globs defined inside of ripgrep.
            
            Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are NOT
            persisted.
            
            Example: rg --type-add 'foo:*.foo' -tfoo PATTERN.
            
            --type-add can also be used to include rules from other types with the special include
            directive. The include directive permits specifying one or more other type names
            (separated by a comma) that have been defined and its rules will automatically be
            imported into the type specified. For example, to create a type called src that matches
            C++, Python and Markdown files, one can use:
            
            --type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md'
            
            Additional glob rules can still be added to the src type by using the --type-add flag
            again:
            
            --type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md' --type-add 'src:*.foo'
            
            Note that type names must consist only of Unicode letters or numbers. Punctuation
            characters are not allowed.
             
        --type-clear <TYPE>...
            Clear the file type globs previously defined for TYPE. This only clears the default type
            definitions that are found inside of ripgrep.
            
            Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are NOT
            persisted.
             
        --type-list
            Show all supported file types and their corresponding globs.
             
    -T, --type-not <TYPE>...
            Do not search files matching TYPE. Multiple type-not flags may be provided. Use the
            --type-list flag to list all available types.
             
    -u, --unrestricted
            Reduce the level of "smart" searching. A single -u won't respect .gitignore (etc.)
            files. Two -u flags will additionally search hidden files and directories. Three -u
            flags will additionally search binary files. -uu is roughly equivalent to grep -r and
            -uuu is roughly equivalent to grep -a -r.
             
        --vimgrep
            Show results with every match on its own line, including line numbers and column
            numbers. With this option, a line with more than one match will be printed more than
            once.
             
    -H, --with-filename
            Prefix each match with the file name that contains it. This is the default when more
            than one file is searched.
             
    -w, --word-regexp
            Only show matches surrounded by word boundaries. This is equivalent to putting \b before
            and after all of the search patterns.
