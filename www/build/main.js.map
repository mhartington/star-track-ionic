For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {@link FormControl} and {@link FormGroup}.\n *\n * @howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include array-level validators as the second arg, or array-level async\n * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n *\n * ### Adding or removing controls\n *\n * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods\n * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the\n * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate\n * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such\n * as broken change detection.\n *\n * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n *\n * @stable\n */\nexport var FormArray = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormArray, _super);\n    function FormArray(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\n        if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\n        if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\n        _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\n        this.controls = controls;\n        this._initObservables();\n        this._setUpControls();\n        this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n    }\n    /**\n     * Get the {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.at = function (index) { return this.controls[index]; };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.push = function (control) {\n        this.controls.push(control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.insert = function (index, control) {\n        ListWrapper.insert(this.controls, index, control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.removeAt = function (index) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        ListWrapper.removeAt(this.controls, index);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.setControl = function (index, control) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        ListWrapper.removeAt(this.controls, index);\n        if (control) {\n            ListWrapper.insert(this.controls, index, control);\n            this._registerControl(control);\n        }\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArray.prototype, \"length\", {\n        /**\n         * Length of the control array.\n         */\n        get: function () { return this.controls.length; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     *  Sets the value of the {@link FormArray}.

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * @howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {@link @Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  @stable\n */\nexport var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

You can also listen to\n * {@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is\n * re-calculated.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * In this example, we create form controls for first name and last name.\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleFormGroup/simple_form_group_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n *  * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n *\n *  * **NgModule**: {@link ReactiveFormsModule}\n *\n *  @stable\n */\nexport var FormControlName = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormControlName, _super);\n    function FormControlName(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this._added = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"isDisabled\", {\n        set: function (isDisabled) { ReactiveErrors.disabledAttrWarning(); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    FormControlName.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if (!this._added)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n            this.formDirective.updateModel(this, this.model);\n        }\n    };\n    FormControlName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n        if (this.formDirective) {\n            this.formDirective.removeControl(this);\n        }\n    };\n    FormControlName.prototype.viewToModelUpdate = function (newValue) {\n        this.viewModel = newValue;\n        this.update.emit(newValue);\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"path\", {\n        get: function () { return controlPath(this.name, this._parent); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n        get: function () { return this._parent ? this._parent.formDirective : null; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"validator\", {\n        get: function () { return composeValidators(this._rawValidators); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"asyncValidator\", {\n        get: function () {\n            return composeAsyncValidators(this._rawAsyncValidators);\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"control\", {\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    FormControlName.prototype._checkParentType = function () {\n        if (!(this._parent instanceof FormGroupName) &&\n            this._parent instanceof AbstractFormGroupDirective) {\n            ReactiveErrors.ngModelGroupException();\n        }\n        else if (!(this._parent instanceof FormGroupName) && !(this._parent instanceof FormGroupDirective) &&\n            !(this._parent instanceof FormArrayName)) {\n            ReactiveErrors.controlParentException();\n        }\n    };\n    FormControlName.prototype._setUpControl = function () {\n        this._checkParentType();\n        this._control = this.formDirective.addControl(this);\n        if (this.control.disabled)\n            this.valueAccessor.setDisabledState(true);\n        this._added = true;\n    };\n    FormControlName.decorators = [\n        { type: Directive, args: [{ selector: '[formControlName]', providers: [controlNameBinding] },] },\n    ];\n    /** @nocollapse */\n    FormControlName.ctorParameters = [\n        { type: ControlContainer, decorators: [{ type: Optional }, { type: Host }, { type: SkipSelf },] },\n        { type: Array, decorators: [{ type: Optional }, { type: Self }, { type: Inject, args: [NG_VALIDATORS,] },] },\n        { type: Array, decorators: [{ type: Optional }, { type: Self }, { type: Inject, args: [NG_ASYNC_VALIDATORS,] },] },\n        { type: Array, decorators: [{ type: Optional }, { type: Self }, { type: Inject, args: [NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,] },] },\n    ];\n    FormControlName.propDecorators = {\n        'name': [{ type: Input, args: ['formControlName',] },],\n        'model': [{ type: Input, args: ['ngModel',] },],\n        'update': [{ type: Output, args: ['ngModelChange',] },],\n        'isDisabled': [{ type: Input, args: ['disabled',] },],\n    };\n    return FormControlName;\n}(NgControl));\n//# sourceMappingURL=form_control_name.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/@angular/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_control_name.js\n// module id = 159\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

It encodes inheritance, properties, and events.\n *\n * ## Overview\n *\n * Each line represents one kind of element. The `element_inheritance` and properties are joined\n * using `element_inheritance|properties` syntax.\n *\n * ## Element Inheritance\n *\n * The `element_inheritance` can be further subdivided as `element1,element2,...^parentElement`.\n * Here the individual elements are separated by `,` (commas). Every element in the list\n * has identical properties.\n *\n * An `element` may inherit additional properties from `parentElement` If no `^parentElement` is\n * specified then `\"\"` (blank) element is assumed.\n *\n * NOTE: The blank element inherits from root `[Element]` element, the super element of all\n * elements.\n *\n * NOTE an element prefix such as `:svg:` has no special meaning to the schema.\n *\n * ## Properties\n *\n * Each element has a set of properties separated by `,` (commas). Each property can be prefixed\n * by a special character designating its type:\n *\n * - (no prefix): property is a string.\n * - `*`: property represents an event.\n * - `!`: property is a boolean.\n * - `#`: property is a number.\n * - `%`: property is an object.\n *\n * ## Query\n *\n * The class creates an internal squas representation which allows to easily answer the query of\n * if a given property exist on a given element.\n *\n * NOTE: We don't yet support querying for types or events.\n * NOTE: This schema is auto extracted from `schema_extractor.ts` located in the test folder,\n *       see dom_element_schema_registry_spec.ts\n */\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n// =========== S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P   -  S T O P  ===========\n// =================================================================================================\n// =================================================================================================\n//\n//                       DO NOT EDIT THIS DOM SCHEMA WITHOUT A SECURITY REVIEW!\n//\n// Newly added properties must be security reviewed and assigned an appropriate SecurityContext in\n// dom_security_schema.ts.

If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {@link Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata\n * page} to gain a better understanding of how animations in Angular2 are used.\n *\n * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given\n * amount of\n * time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n * used within {@link sequence an animation sequence}, {@link group group}, or {@link transition\n * transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n * form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {@link style style} or {@link\n * keyframes keyframes}.\n * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n * useful when\n * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {@link\n * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n */\nexport function animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!isPresent(stylesEntry)) {\n        var EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

The format format varies depending on your platform. On Android advertising data will be the raw advertising bytes. iOS does not allow access to raw advertising data, so a dictionary of data is returned.\n *\n * The advertising information for both Android and iOS appears to be a combination of advertising data and scan response data.\n *\n * ### Android\n *\n * ```typescript\n *   {\n *       \"name\": \"demo\",\n *       \"id\": \"00:1A:7D:DA:71:13\",\n *       \"advertising\": ArrayBuffer,\n *      \"rssi\": -37\n *  }\n * ```\n *\n * Convert the advertising info to a Uint8Array for processing. `var adData = new Uint8Array(peripheral.advertising)`\n *\n * ### iOS\n *\n * Note that iOS uses the string value of the constants for the [Advertisement Data Retrieval Keys](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CBCentralManagerDelegate_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Advertisement_Data_Retrieval_Keys). This will likely change in the future.\n *\n * ```typescript\n *   {\n *       \"name\": \"demo\",\n *       \"id\": \"D8479A4F-7517-BCD3-91B5-3302B2F81802\",\n *       \"advertising\": {\n *           \"kCBAdvDataChannel\": 37,\n *           \"kCBAdvDataServiceData\": {\n *               \"FED8\": {\n *                   \"byteLength\": 7 // data not shown\n *               }\n *           },\n *           \"kCBAdvDataLocalName\": \"demo\",\n *           \"kCBAdvDataServiceUUIDs\": [\"FED8\"],\n *           \"kCBAdvDataManufacturerData\": {\n *               \"byteLength\": 7  // data not shown\n *           },\n *           \"kCBAdvDataTxPowerLevel\": 32,\n *           \"kCBAdvDataIsConnectable\": true\n *       },\n *       \"rssi\": -53\n *   }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Typed Arrays\n *\n * This plugin uses typed Arrays or ArrayBuffers for sending and receiving data.\n *\n * This means that you need convert your data to ArrayBuffers before sending and from ArrayBuffers when receiving.\n *\n * ```typescript\n *   // ASCII only\n *   function stringToBytes(string) {\n *      var array = new Uint8Array(string.length);\n *      for (var i = 0, l = string.length; i < l; i++) {\n *          array[i] = string.charCodeAt(i);\n *       }\n *       return array.buffer;\n *   }\n *\n *   // ASCII only\n *   function bytesToString(buffer) {\n *       return String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(buffer));\n *   }\n * ```\n * You can read more about typed arrays in these articles on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) and [HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webgl/typed_arrays/).\n *\n * ## UUIDs\n *\n * UUIDs are always strings and not numbers. Some 16-bit UUIDs, such as '2220' look like integers, but they're not. (The integer 2220 is 0x8AC in hex.) This isn't a problem with 128 bit UUIDs since they look like strings 82b9e6e1-593a-456f-be9b-9215160ebcac. All 16-bit UUIDs should also be passed to methods as strings.\n *\n */\nexport var BLE = (function () {\n    function BLE() {\n    }\n    /**\n     * Scan and discover BLE peripherals for the specified amount of time.\n     *\n     * @usage\n     * ```\n     * BLE.scan([], 5).subscribe(device => {\n     *   console.log(JSON.stringify(device));\n     * });\n     * ```\n     * @param {string[]} services  List of service UUIDs to discover, or `[]` to find all devices\n     * @param {number} seconds  Number of seconds to run discovery\n     * @return Returns an Observable that notifies of each peripheral that is discovered during the specified time.\n     */\n    BLE.scan = function (services, seconds) { return; };\n    /**\n     * Scan and discover BLE peripherals until `stopScan` is called.\n     *\n     * @usage\n     * ```\n     * BLE.startScan([]).subscribe(device => {\n     *   console.log(JSON.stringify(device));\n     * });\n     *\n     * setTimeout(() => {\n     *   BLE.stopScan();\n     * }, 5000);\n     * ```\n     * @param {string[]} services  List of service UUIDs to discover, or `[]` to find all devices\n     * @return Returns an Observable that notifies of each peripheral discovered.\n     */\n    BLE.startScan = function (services) { return; };\n    /**\n     * Scans for BLE devices.

FB application on iOS and Android.\n *\n * Requires Cordova plugin: `cordova-plugin-facebook4`. For more info, please see the [Facebook Connect](https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4).\n *\n * #### Installation\n *\n *  To use the FB plugin, you first have to create a new Facebook App inside of the Facebook developer portal at [https://developers.facebook.com/apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).\n *\n * [![fb-getstarted-1](/img/docs/native/Facebook/1.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n *\n * Retrieve the `App ID` and `App Name`.\n *\n * [![fb-getstarted-2](/img/docs/native/Facebook/2.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n *\n * Then type in the following command in your Terminal, where APP_ID and APP_NAME are the values from the Facebook Developer portal.\n *\n * ```bash\n *  ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-facebook4 --save --variable APP_ID=\"123456789\" --variable APP_NAME=\"myApplication\"\n * ```\n *\n * After, you'll need to add the native platforms you'll be using to your app in the Facebook Developer portal under your app's Settings:\n *\n * [![fb-getstarted-3](/img/docs/native/Facebook/3.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n *\n * Click `'Add Platform'`.\n *\n * [![fb-getstarted-4](/img/docs/native/Facebook/4.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n *\n * At this point you'll need to open your project's [`config.xml`](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/index.html) file, found in the root directory of your project.\n *\n * Take note of the `id` for the next step:\n * ```\n * <widget id=\"com.mycompany.testapp\" version=\"0.0.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets\" xmlns:cdv=\"http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0\">\n * ```\n *\n * You can also edit the `id` to whatever you'd like it to be.\n *\n * #### iOS Install\n * Under 'Bundle ID', add the `id` from your `config.xml` file:\n *\n * [![fb-getstarted-5](/img/docs/native/Facebook/5.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n *\n *\n * #### Android Install\n * Under 'Google Play Package Name', add the `id` from your `config.xml` file:\n *\n * [![fb-getstarted-6](/img/docs/native/Facebook/6.png)](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)\n *\n *\n * And that's it! You can now make calls to Facebook using the plugin.\n *\n * ## Events\n *\n * App events allow you to understand the makeup of users engaging with your app, measure the performance of your Facebook mobile app ads, and reach specific sets of your users with Facebook mobile app ads.\n *\n * - [iOS] [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/app-events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/app-events)\n * - [Android] [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/app-events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/app-events)\n * - [JS] Does not have an Events API, so the plugin functions are empty and will return an automatic success\n *\n * Activation events are automatically tracked for you in the plugin.\n *\n * Events are listed on the [insights page](https://www.facebook.com/insights/).\n *\n * For tracking events, see `logEvent` and `logPurchase`.\n *\n * @usage\n * ```typescript\n * import { Facebook } from 'ionic-native';\n *\n *\n *\n * ```\n *\n */\nexport var Facebook = (function () {\n    function Facebook() {\n    }\n    /**\n     * Browser wrapper\n     * @param {number} appId Your Facebook AppID from their dashboard\n     * @param {string} version The version of API you may want to use.

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * @stable\n */\nexport var NgFor = (function () {\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.

The goal is to allow users to avoid the\n  most obvious pitfalls and do so without compromising performance significantly.\n  For ShadowDOM styling that's not covered here, a set of best practices\n  can be provided that should allow users to accomplish more complex styling.\n\n  The following is a list of specific ShadowDOM styling features and a brief\n  discussion of the approach used to shim.\n\n  Shimmed features:\n\n  * :host, :host-context: ShadowDOM allows styling of the shadowRoot's host\n  element using the :host rule. To shim this feature, the :host styles are\n  reformatted and prefixed with a given scope name and promoted to a\n  document level stylesheet.\n  For example, given a scope name of .foo, a rule like this:\n\n    :host {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n    .foo {\n      background: red;\n    }\n\n  * encapsulation: Styles defined within ShadowDOM, apply only to\n  dom inside the ShadowDOM. Polymer uses one of two techniques to implement\n  this feature.\n\n  By default, rules are prefixed with the host element tag name\n  as a descendant selector. This ensures styling does not leak out of the 'top'\n  of the element's ShadowDOM. For example,\n\n  div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n  x-foo div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n\n  Alternatively, if WebComponents.ShadowCSS.strictStyling is set to true then\n  selectors are scoped by adding an attribute selector suffix to each\n  simple selector that contains the host element tag name. Each element\n  in the element's ShadowDOM template is also given the scope attribute.\n  Thus, these rules match only elements that have the scope attribute.\n  For example, given a scope name of x-foo, a rule like this:\n\n    div {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  becomes:\n\n    div[x-foo] {\n      font-weight: bold;\n    }\n\n  Note that elements that are dynamically added to a scope must have the scope\n  selector added to them manually.\n\n  * upper/lower bound encapsulation: Styles which are defined outside a\n  shadowRoot should not cross the ShadowDOM boundary and should not apply\n  inside a shadowRoot.\n\n  This styling behavior is not emulated. Some possible ways to do this that\n  were rejected due to complexity and/or performance concerns include: (1) reset\n  every possible property for every possible selector for a given scope name;\n  (2) re-implement css in javascript.\n\n  As an alternative, users should make sure to use selectors\n  specific to the scope in which they are working.\n\n  * ::distributed: This behavior is not emulated. It's often not necessary\n  to style the contents of a specific insertion point and instead, descendants\n  of the host element can be styled selectively. Users can also create an\n  extra node around an insertion point and style that node's contents\n  via descendent selectors. For example, with a shadowRoot like this:\n\n    <style>\n      ::content(div) {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <content></content>\n\n  could become:\n\n    <style>\n      / *@polyfill .content-container div * /\n      ::content(div) {\n        background: red;\n      }\n    </style>\n    <div class=\"content-container\">\n      <content></content>\n    </div>\n\n  Note the use of @polyfill in the comment above a ShadowDOM specific style\n  declaration. This is a directive to the styling shim to use the selector\n  in comments in lieu of the next selector when running under polyfill.\n*/\nexport var ShadowCss = (function () {\n    function ShadowCss() {\n        this.strictStyling = true;\n    }\n    /*\n    * Shim some cssText with the given selector.
